# Active-Directory-Security-Lab

## Description
This lab involves building and securing an Active Directory (AD) environment. It includes simulating common attack vectors and implementing defensive measures to enhance the security of the AD infrastructure. The goal is to develop practical skills in AD management, security hardening, and responding to threats.

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Active Directory management
- Group Policy Object (GPO) hardening
- Attack simulation and analysis
- Implementing defensive measures in AD environments

---

## Lab Objectives
1. **Build** an AD environment with appropriate structure and permissions.
2. **Simulate attacks** using tools like BloodHound or Mimikatz.
3. **Document** the steps and results of the attack simulations.
4. **Implement defenses** against simulated attacks, including:
   - Applying least privilege principles.
   - Strengthening password policies.
   - Hardening Group Policy settings.

---

## Deliverables
1. **AD Structure Diagram**: A detailed visual representation of the AD structure, including domains, OUs, groups, and permissions.
2. **Attack Simulation Documentation**: Step-by-step documentation of the attack simulations, including:
   - Tools used (e.g., BloodHound, Mimikatz).
   - Methods employed to exploit vulnerabilities.
   - Observations and outcomes.
3. **Mitigation Steps**: A comprehensive guide to the actions taken to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities, such as:
   - Implementing least privilege access.
   - Enforcing strong password policies.
   - Modifying Group Policy settings for improved security.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Active Directory**
- **BloodHound**
- **Mimikatz**
- **PowerShell**
- **Group Policy Management Console (GPMC)**
- **Windows Server**

---

## Future Improvements
- Add more sophisticated attack simulations.
- Explore real-time monitoring using SIEM tools.
- Incorporate incident response automation.
