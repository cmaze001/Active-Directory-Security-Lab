### Mitigating Password Policy Vulnerabilities  

#### Before Configuration
- **Password Complexity Disabled:** Users could set simple passwords (e.g., "password").
- **Password Length Minimum:** 6 characters.
- **Account Lockout Threshold:** Disabled (unlimited failed login attempts).

To view current settings:
```powershell
Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy | Select-Object ComplexityEnabled, MinimumPasswordLength, LockoutThreshold
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
ComplexityEnabled: False
MinimumPasswordLength: 6
LockoutThreshold: 0
```

---

#### After Configuration
- **Password Complexity Enabled:** Ensures passwords include upper/lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- **Minimum Password Length:** Increased to 12 characters.
- **Account Lockout Threshold:** Set to 5 invalid attempts, with a 15-minute lockout duration.

To update settings:
```powershell
Set-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy -ComplexityEnabled $true -MinimumPasswordLength 12 -LockoutThreshold 5 -LockoutDuration 15
```

To confirm the new settings:
```powershell
Get-ADDefaultDomainPasswordPolicy | Select-Object ComplexityEnabled, MinimumPasswordLength, LockoutThreshold
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
ComplexityEnabled: True
MinimumPasswordLength: 12
LockoutThreshold: 5
```

### Validation
1. Attempt to set a weak password (e.g., "password").
   - Result: **Blocked.**
2. Simulate five incorrect login attempts with a valid user account.
   - Result: **Account locked for 15 minutes.**
